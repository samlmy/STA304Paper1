# STA304Paper1

This is a project for the University of Toronto STA304 by Professor Rohan Alexandar.

In this project, I chose to conduct a short analysis on the Police Annual Statistical Report-Search of Persons from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal using statistical programming language R. In order for you to produce the same results as I did, please follow the instructions below:
1. Download the Zip file on your computer from this GitHub page
2. Open and run the data_download.R file on your local Rstudio or Rstudio.cloud to obtain the dataset
3. Open the paper.Rmd file in outputs/paper
4. Use the knit function in Rstudio to generate the pdf file of the report
